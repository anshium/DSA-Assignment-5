I will be basing my approach on the flood fill algorithm.

I would be doing the following:

1. Start with (1, 1) - 1 indexing
2. Flood fill all around it with the same height.
3. While doing 2, add everything that was at the non-grid boundary to some datatype.
4. Then one by one, extract them and recursively do flood fill on each of them and try to reach (N, N)
5. Count the steps in the meanwhile.
6. Once reached the (N, N) point, check if the number of times the elevator was used.
